Gold rate increase :&nbsp;
1) Minig process is less so production is less , more demand
2) Production in every industry is less, so investors invest in gold , demand is more

3) Reserve&nbsp;currency
	dollar - &gt; gold
	Before recession or pandemic dollar was user for exchanges( petrol ,oil, electornic goods)
    but during recession or pandemic dollar's value becomes less so people, banks start to keep the gold stock 
	so demand is increasing for gold
4) quantitative easing == getting monay for vote in politics
	a person with salary 100$ and one with 200$ can buy
	1kg tomato = &gt; 100$
    when demand for tomato(production is less) is more every one cant afford 
	1kg of tomato for 100$, 
    so because of low-economy government start to print currency papers.
    Now both of them will get salary of 150$ and 250$ respectively, but the tomato production remains same.
    So, the quantitaive easing seems to be the immediate-solution for low economy, 
	within that time people should start producing more tomatoes to change the situation back to normal.
